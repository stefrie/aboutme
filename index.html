                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    Hi all! I'm Stefanie Riehle - my pronouns are she/her, I've been in HR for the last 8   years or so, pivoting to coding so I can have better work-life balance and pay. I'm excited for this class because I previously took a (free) bootcamp where I learned this stuff but glossed over a lot of really important things, so I'm hoping to reinforce what I learned previously, but also deep-dive into learning all the things I don't know (or at least learn tip of the gigantic iceberg that is programming). I'm looking forward to working with some of the same folks I met in Code 102, and to meeting new people as well.
                    </p>
