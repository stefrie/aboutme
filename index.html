                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    Hi all! I'm Stefanie Riehle - my pronouns are she/her, I'm a former HR professional making the switch to coding like I should have done over 20 years ago. I live in Seattle with a precocious 5-year old part of the time and with many, many plants all of the time.

                        My primary goal is to have a solid understanding of JavaScript so that I can become a full-stack developer. My next goal is to find a role with a mid-sized tech company with transparent leadership and a fantastic company culture.
