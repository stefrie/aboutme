                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    Hi all! I'm Stefanie Riehle - my pronouns are she/her, I've been in HR for the last 8   years or so, pivoting to coding so I can have better work-life balance and pay. I'm excited for this class because I previously took a (free) bootcamp where I learned this stuff but glossed over a lot of really important things, so I'm hoping to reinforce what I learned previously, but also deep-dive into learning all the things I don't know (or at least learn tip of the gigantic iceberg that is programming). I'm looking forward to working with some of the same folks I met in Code 102, and to meeting new people as well.

                    <h2>Education History</h2>
                    I graduated with my Bachelors degree in Organizational Leadership from Northern Kentucky University in 2013. I also attended a Front-end JavaScript Developer bootcamp run by Generation USA that wrapped up in February 2021. At present, I'm attending Code Fellows bootcamp, training to become a full-stack JavaScript Developer, and my expected graduation date is December 2021.

                    Most recently, I worked in Human Resources in a variety of industries, but predominantly in the Seattle tech sector. Prior to HR, I worked in many different jobs in many different industries:

                    <h2>My Goals</h2>
                    My primary goal is to have a solid understanding of JavaScript so that I can become a full-stack developer. My next goal is to find a role with a mid-sized tech company with transparent leadership and a fantastic company culture.
